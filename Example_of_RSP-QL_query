This query continuously look for bars where people are falling in love like Paolo and Francesca in Dante's Divine Comedy because of a book by Gallehault.

The query checks :

    over the default graph containing the points of interest (POIs) of http://somesocialnetwork.org/ that the POI is a bar.
    over the entire stream from http://someinvasivesensornetwork.org, that pairs of people entered in the poi in different moments within 4 hours.
    over the same stream, with a long lasting time window of 1 hour, that pairs of those people have been staying close by for at least 30 minutes. Note: that this may require some resoning being the property isCloseBy symmetric.
    over the same stream but with a short time window of 10 minutes, that the same pairs exit together.

As output, for each bar, it streams out an RDF graph with the list of pairs and the total number of pairs that felt in love.

Note that this example query covers features of C-SPARQL, CQELS, SPARQL-Stream, EP-SPARQL as well as new features missing in all RSP languages:

    From C-SPARQL it takes the REGISTER clause, the FROM STREAM clause as dataset clause, the AT clause to access the timestamp (in C-SPARQL, AT is implemented with the timestamp() function) and the aggregates (which are computed in parallel without shrinking the result set, but extending it).
# so what is the AT time function doing? where is that timestamp coming from? 
    From CQELS it takes the idea of the STREAM keyword in the WHERE clause.
    From SPARQL-Stream it takes the ISTREAM clasue that ask the RSP engine to use the R2S operator.

    From EP-SPARQL, it takes the SEQ and the WITH DURATION clauses (in EP-SPARQL, WITHIN DURATION is implemented with the getDuration() function).

-->if we introduces new keyword SEQ for expressing order constraint, why don't we introduce keywords for 13 Allen's interval operator? for instance, BEFORE/MEETS/OVERLAPS/STARTS/DURING/FINISHES/EQUAL + inverse version of them (practically, it's the same effort for parsing)

The new features are:

    the usage of an IRI to identify the query (and its stream of results)
    the optional UNDER ENTAILMENT REGIME clause
    the FROM NAMED STREAM <<stream iri>> <<window>> AS << window name>> clause in the dataset declaration
    the WINDOW keyword in the WHERE clause
    --> is there any shorter way to express this? for instance, just STREAM keyword inside WHERE?

# this looks a bit different than sparql in terms of order of query blocks, would it harm to make it something like:
# PREFIX ...
# CONSTRUCT ISTREAM { ...etc
# FROM ....
# WHERE { ...
# AS :GallehaultWasTheBar
# UNDER ENTAILMENT xxx...

#are we creating a different type of aggregate syntax? i.e. not the one from SPARQL1.1? ok, for the construct you need something else, but could it be done with a subquery right?
